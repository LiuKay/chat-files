## LangChain

**LangChain** is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It enables applications that:

- **Are context-aware**: connect a language model to sources of context (prompt instructions, few shot examples, content to ground its response in, etc.)
- **Reason**: rely on a language model to reason (about how to answer based on provided context, what actions to take, etc.)

The main value props of LangChain are:

1. **Components**: abstractions for working with language models, along with a collection of implementations for each abstraction. Components are modular and easy-to-use, whether you are using the rest of the LangChain framework or not
2. **Off-the-shelf chains**: a structured assembly of components for accomplishing specific higher-level tasks

Off-the-shelf chains make it easy to get started. For complex applications, components make it easy to customize existing chains and build new ones.

## Chainlit

Chainlit is an open-source Python package that makes it incredibly fast to build Chat GPT like applications with your own business logic and data.

Key features of Chainlit:
1.Build fast: Integrate seamlessly with an existing code base or start from scratch in minutes

2.Data persistence: Leverage user generated data + feedback.

3.Visualize multi-steps reasoning: Understand the intermediary steps that produced an output at a glance

4.Iterate on prompts: Deep dive into prompts in the Prompt Playground to understand where things went wrong and iterate

Chainlit is compatible with all Python programs and libraries. That being said, it comes with a set of integrations with popular libraries and frameworks.
